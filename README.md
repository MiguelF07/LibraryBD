# Library DataBase Management
This project is the final project of the Databases curricular unit.

It was made to manage library data stored in a database, with the UI made on Visual Studio (Windows Forms and C#) and the database on SQL Management Studio.

## Files

The **SQL files** are in the '**Ficheiros SQL Folder**'.
The '**atividades.sql**' file has the SQL of the activities; the '**biblioteca.sql**' file has the SQL of the library data; the '**consultar.sql**' file has the SQL of the 'Consultar' page, where we can see data from the Library entities; the '**consultas.sql**' file has some examples of SQL commands that we did in our project; the '**DDL.sql**' file has the SQL of the creation of tables; the '**emprestimos.sql**' file has the SQL of the 'Empr√©stimos' page, where we can manage people's requests, etc...; and the '**Inserts.sql**' file has all of the SQL insertion commands with examples of data.

The Visual Studio project is inside the '**LibraryBD**' folder.

The '**Documents**' folder contains the written report of our projetc, the presentation slides that were used in class, the DB Diagram, that was generated on SQL Management Studio, and a file named 'Consultas-Exemplo.pdf' that contains examples of SQL commands and the results.
